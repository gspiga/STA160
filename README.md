In this project, we are interested in exploring this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgreenwell/narcissistic-personality-inventory-responses?select=data.csv

Here we can explore through 40 survey questions the best way of measuring a person's narcissism. This is done by summing the total of said survey questions to create a final score. Along with this, we can also take into account a person's age and gender in predicting trends for narcissism.
